# Udacity_Deep_Reinforcement_Learning

### Project Details

A reward of +1 is provided for collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of -1 is provided for collecting a blue banana. Thus, the goal of your agent is to collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding blue bananas.

The state space has 37 dimensions and contains the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around the agent's forward direction. Given this information, the agent has to learn how to best select actions. Four discrete actions are available, corresponding to:

0 - move forward.
1 - move backward.
2 - turn left.
3 - turn right.
The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, your agent must get an average score of +13 over 100 consecutive episodes.

### Getting Started

1. To start, please follow the [instructions in the course GitHub repository](https://github.com/udacity/Value-based-methods#dependencies) to set up the Python environment.

2. Next, download the Unity Environment from one of the links below:

- Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana.app.zip)
- Windows (32-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86.zip)
- Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86_64.zip)

Then, place the file in the p1_navigation/ folder in the course GitHub repository, and unzip (or decompress) the file.

### Instructions

After you have followed the instructions above, open Navigation.ipynb and follow the instructions to learn how to use the Python API to control the agent.
